## What's This About?

This project is a custom Power BI dashboard analyzing HDFC Bank’s performance in India’s competitive banking landscape. It visualizes critical metrics like deposits, loans, credit card usage, and savings, helping to compare performance with other banks. Think of it as a control center for tracking financial speed and strategy.


## Data Collection & Cleaning

I collected data from the RBI website (April 2022–March 2023) using automated scripts built with Selenium and Requests. After extracting the Excel files, I cleaned and standardized the data—removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency across all entries. This preprocessing ensures the insights derived from the dashboard are accurate, reliable, and ready for meaningful banking analysis.
